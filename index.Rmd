<font size="4.5">My name is Martín Jacinto and I am a proud first-generation college graduate, former community college transfer student, and proud son of Mexican immigrants. I am also proud of my hometown of [Santa Paula, CA](https://spcity.org/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Irvine in 2022. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology at California State University, Chico. My primary teaching and research specializations include globalization, development, economic sociology, social network analysis, inequality and stratification, and quantitative research methods. I am also an experienced researcher specializing in end-to-end design and execution of mixed methods research (quantitative and qualitative) including survey design and analysis, Bayesian statistics, time-series, and analysis of social networks. Finally, I'm passionate about using data to tell stories that engage audiences with rich, high-quality content and accessible language.
