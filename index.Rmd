<font size="4.5">As a first-generation college graduate and a former community college transfer student (Ventura Community College), I carry immense pride in my heritage as the son of Mexican immigrants. My hometown, Santa Paula, holds a special place in my heart, and I celebrate its influence on my journey.

I earned my Ph.D. and a M.A. in Sociology from the University of California, Irvine in 2022.  I also have a M.A. in Latin American and Iberian Studies and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2022, I joined the [College of Behavioral and Social Sciences at California State University, Chico](https://catalog.csuchico.edu/colleges-departments/college-behavioral-social-sciences/sociology/#text) as an Assistant Professor of Sociology. My primary teaching and research specializations include global political economy, development, economic sociology, inequality and stratification, social network analysis, and quantitative research methods. I also have experience as a researcher specializing in end-to-end design and execution of mixed methods research (quantitative and qualitative) including survey design and analysis, Bayesian statistics, time-series, and analysis of social networks. Finally, I'm passionate about using data to tell stories that engage audiences with rich, high-quality content and accessible language.

As a first-generation Latino scholar, I acknowledge the needs of an increasingly diverse student body and welcome the challenge of improving diversity, inclusion, and equity on campus. Having taught at multiple top Hispanic-serving institutions, such as the California State University (CSU), Dominguez Hills, CSU Long Beach, and the University of California-Irvine, exposed me to students of various cultures, languages and learning abilities. From this exposure, I developed a pedagogical style that draws on my students’ diverse identities, perspectives, and experiences to optimize their learning experience. I develop and apply learning materials that amplify the research of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ scholars that examine issues affecting disenfranchised communities.  

Prior to joining Chico State in 2022, I was a UC Irvine Kugelman Citizen Peacebuilding Research Fellow, UC Irvine Center for Networks and Relational Analysis Research Fellow, [UC Irvine Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation Pedagogical Fellow](https://dtei.uci.edu/opportunities/grads-postdocs/pedagogical-fellows-program/), and a 2020 recipient of the [Tom Angell Fellowship Award](https://inclusion.uci.edu/action-plan/mentoring/tom-angell-fellowship-award/).
