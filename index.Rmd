<font size="4.5">As a first-generation college graduate and a former community college transfer student (Ventura Community College), I carry immense pride in my heritage as the son of Mexican immigrants. My hometown, Santa Paula, CA, holds a special place in my heart, and I celebrate its influence on my journey. 

In 2022, I earned a Ph.D. in Sociology and an M.A. in Latin American and Iberian Studies from the University of California, Irvine, supplementing my earlier B.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. That same year, I began my career as an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the [College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, California State University, Chico](https://www.csuchico.edu/soci/faculty-staff.shtml). My expertise lies in global political economy, development, economic sociology, inequality and stratification, social network analysis, and quantitative research methods. I am adept in mixed methods research, encompassing survey design, time series analysis, and social network analysis, leveraging quantitative and qualitative approaches. My passion lies in transforming data into compelling narratives and presenting rich, high-quality content accessible to engage diverse audiences.

As a first-generation Latino scholar, I acknowledge the needs of an increasingly diverse student body and welcome the challenge of improving diversity, inclusion, and equity on campus. Having taught at multiple top Hispanic-serving institutions, such as the California State University (CSU), Dominguez Hills, CSU Long Beach, and the University of California-Irvine, exposed me to students of various cultures, languages and learning abilities. From this exposure, I developed a pedagogical style that draws on my students’ diverse identities, perspectives, and experiences to optimize their learning experience. I develop and apply learning materials that amplify the research of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ scholars that examine issues affecting disenfranchised communities.

Prior to joining Chico State in 2022, I was a UC Irvine Kugelman Citizen Peacebuilding Research Fellow, UC Irvine Center for Networks and Relational Analysis Research Fellow, [UC Irvine Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation Pedagogical Fellow](https://dtei.uci.edu/opportunities/grads-postdocs/pedagogical-fellows-program/), and a 2020 recipient of the [Tom Angell Fellowship Award](https://inclusion.uci.edu/action-plan/mentoring/tom-angell-fellowship-award/). I love teaching!
