<font size="4.5">My name is Mart√≠n Jacinto and I am a proud first-generation college graduate, former community college transfer student, and proud son of Mexican immigrants. I am also proud of my hometown of [Santa Paula, CA](https://spcity.org/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Irvine in 2022.  I also have a Master's degree in Latin American and Iberian Studies and a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2022, I joined the [College of Behavioral and Social Sciences at California State University, Chico](https://catalog.csuchico.edu/colleges-departments/college-behavioral-social-sciences/sociology/#text) as an Assistant Professor of Sociology. My primary teaching and research specializations include global political economy, development, economic sociology, social network analysis, inequality and stratification, and quantitative research methods. I am also an experienced researcher specializing in end-to-end design and execution of mixed methods research (quantitative and qualitative) including survey design and analysis, Bayesian statistics, time-series, and analysis of social networks. Finally, I'm passionate about using data to tell stories that engage audiences with rich, high-quality content and accessible language.

Prior to joining Chico State in 2022, I was a UC Irvine Kugelman Citizen Peacebuilding Research Fellow, UC Irvine Center for Networks and Relational Analysis Research Fellow, UC Irvine Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation Pedagogical Fellow, and a 2020 recipient of the [Tom Angell Fellowship Award](https://inclusion.uci.edu/action-plan/mentoring/tom-angell-fellowship-award/).
