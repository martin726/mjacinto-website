<h2>**Teaching as a Social Act**</h2>
I am the son of immigrant farm workers from Mexico and a first-generation college student that started his academic career at a community college. Well-aware and sympathetic to the needs of a growing diverse student population, I strive to engage with these students and nurture meaningful mentoring relationships that help them succeed academically and professionally.

My teaching interests include globalization and quantitative methods. Below are class syllabi and information regarding my teaching experience.
