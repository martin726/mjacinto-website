<h3>**TEACHING PHILOSOPHY**</h3>
I am the son of immigrant farm workers from Mexico and a first-generation college student. My academic trajectory began at [Ventura Community College](https://www.venturacollege.edu/) and am proud to be a former community college student. Well-aware and sympathetic to the needs of a growing diverse student population, I strive to engage with these students and nurture meaningful mentoring relationships that help them succeed academically and professionally. Additionally, I acknowledge that pedagogical approaches must continually grow and develop to adapt to the dynamic needs of students. 

My pedagogical practices focus on student-centered learning that stimulates student engagement with the course material. Specifically, I integrate active-learning strategies into my teaching to foster and invigorate an inclusive and equitable learning environment. More importantly, as a first-generation Latino educator, I ensure that diversity, equity, and inclusion is not only acknowledged in the classroom but integrated into the course curriculum.

I am dedicated to not only teaching my students, but empowering them to further apply their sociological knowledge to public affairs and community programs by conducting their own independent research. By mentoring a student’s growth as a researcher, students also learn to hone their voice and articulate their research to wider audiences. In doing so, I hope to assist my students’ development as an actively participating member of the civic society where  they may advocate on their own behalf, define their own futures, and inspire the next generation. As such, I am committed and ready to contribute to the sociology program’s learning objectives of developing students’ sociological imagination while also preparing them for graduate studies and careers in criminal justice, law, social services, complex organizations, and teaching.
