<h2>**Teaching as a Social Act**</h2>
I am the son of immigrant farm workers from Mexico and a first-generation college student. My academic trajectory began at [Ventura Community College](https://www.venturacollege.edu/) and am proud to be a former community college student. Well-aware and sympathetic to the needs of a growing diverse student population, I strive to engage with these students and nurture meaningful mentoring relationships that help them succeed academically and professionally. Additionally, I acknowledge that pedagogical approaches must continually grow and develop to adapt to the dynamic needs of students.
